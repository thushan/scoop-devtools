# scoop-devtools
A [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) repository that contains developer tools that may not fit the [main scoop bucket](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Main).

# Adding `scoop-devtools` bucket

You can add this bucket to your Scoop Bucket list with:

```
$ scoop bucket add devtools https://github.com/thushan/scoop-devtools
```

Installing packages from this bucket will be just like any other bucket thereafter.

# Update schedule

Updates to the bucket will be automatically run for most packages that have `autoupdate` set.
